          I was born in a small town in the Venezuelan Andes, Mérida. Surrounded
          by nature I learned to recognize the smell of the river in the air, to
          read the clouds to know when the rain is coming, I joined the foliage
          and created a world among the forests, I grew up to travel and along
          the way I found myself creating. Since then I have learned everything
          I can and I try to connect everyone's existence with mine through
          knowledge. On the other hand, technology grew at my pace but not in
          front of my eyes, although, as soon as I could see it and peek behind
          the curtain to see how it works, I was captivated to see so clearly
          the similarity with our world, with the perpetual desire of the human
          being to preserve his knowledge, to share it, with the need to
          communicate and understand each other, with the grace to create
          increasingly complex things but always within that familiar and
          liberating flow of creation, complexity disguised as simplicity. I
          fell in love, and every day I fall in love again. I decided to
          dedicate myself to this world while I enjoy the other, I’m excited to
          see the path that exists in front of me, I know that I’m not going
          alone, that there are thousands of great people willing to do better
          every day and I want to join them.
